# Un-Redactor
A PDF editing tool that lets you unredact, put your own information over a redaction box, and extract all text.

This tool is for forensics purposes. It does not "recover" data truly destroyed by redaction tools.

What it **does** do is allow you to **write over** a redaction box. Like white-out.

You can select a redaction box, and select all of the exact dimensions and replace at once.

I am not responsible for your use of this tool.

Republishing altered documents is illegal, and you should not use this to do so.

By using this tool you claim all legal liability for any documents you create with it.

You can now view the results of this tool at https:/www.uttcex.net/kvthweatt/unredactor

Update: Added an "Auto Unredact" option!  
- Select a folder where your PDF files are located, and an HTML output folder.
- Automatically attempts to extract all text streams by raw text extraction and OCR.
- Creates an index.html for easy navigation!

The executable form was compiled with Nuitka, you may need to install [Python](https://www.python.org/) if you do not have it.
