# Un-Redactor
A PDF editing tool that lets you put your own information over a redaction box, and extract all text.

This tool is for forensics purposes. It does not "recover" data truly destroyed by redaction tools.

What it **does** do is allow you to **write over** a redaction box. Like white-out.

You can select a redaction box, and select all of the exact dimensions and replace at once.

I am not responsible for your use of this tool.

Republishing altered documents is illegal, and you should not use this to do so.

By using this tool you claim all legal liability for any documents you create with it.

Update: Added a "Unredact All" button to extract all text to check for weak redaction.

The executable form was compiled with Nuitka, you may need to install [Python](https://www.python.org/) if you do not have it.
