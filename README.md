# Un-Redactor
A PDF editing tool that lets you put your own information over a redaction box.

This tool is for forensics purposes. It does not "recover" data truly destroyed by redaction tools.

What it **does** do is allow you to **write over** a redaction box. Like white-out.

You can select a redaction box, and select all of the exact dimensions and replace at once.

I am not responsible for your use of this tool.

Republishing altered documents is illegal, and you should not use this to do so.

By using this tool you claim all legal liability for any documents you create with it.

KNOWN ISSUE:  
- This converts to PNG then back to PDF, causing the document to expand exponentially each time you change a box.  
- Consequent to that, the font size remains the same so your box text gets smaller and smaller.

The executable form was compiled with Nuitka in standalone mode.
